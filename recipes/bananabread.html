    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
            Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. 
            Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl. 
            Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer 
            until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
             Stir banana mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour mixture until just blended. 
             Fold in chocolate chips; pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center 
            comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before 
            removing to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add garlic and shrimp paste to the wok and stir well. Cook for 2 minutes, 
            then add fish sauce mixture and drained noodles. 
            Cook until the noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Push noodles to one side of the wok. Crack the eggs into the other side. 
            Scramble until firm, about 3 minutes. Stir into the noodles. 
            Serve with peanuts, bean sprouts, and lime wedges.
        </li>

    </ol>
